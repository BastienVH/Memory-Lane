# CS50x final project
This application is my final project for the course CS50x by Harvard.
After submission, I will continue to work on this project to add features and other enhancements.

## Description
(no-name) is a self-hosted web app that allows you to create an online image gallery and securely share it with friends and family.
No passwords are required, you only need an e-mailaddress to login.
It was made with sharing pictures of your children in mind, but can also be used as regular image gallery.
